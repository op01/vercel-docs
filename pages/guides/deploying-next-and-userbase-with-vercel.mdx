[Userbase](https://userbase.com/) is the easiest way to add user accounts and data persistence to your static site.

All Userbase features are accessible through a [JavaScript SDK](https://userbase.com/docs/sdk/), directly from the browser, without requiring a backend.

## Step 1: Create A Userbase Account

First, you'll need to create a Userbase account. If you don't already have one, you can create one [here](https://v1.userbase.com/#create-admin).

After creating your account, make a note of your _App ID_. You'll store it later as an environment variable for your project.

## Step 2: Set up a New Next.js Project

Set up a Next.js and Userbase project by initializing the [project template](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-userbase) and moving into the project directory:

<Snippet dark text="npm init next-app --example with-userbase userbase-todo-app && cd userbase-todo-app" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js + Userbase app and entering into the project directory.</Caption>

## Step 3: Adding an Environment Variable

For your app to function correctly, you will need to provide it with an environment variable.

<Note>
  You will need to set this environment variable when importing the project into
  Vercel as well.
</Note>

The scaffolded template provides you with a `.env.local.example` file. Rename the file to `.env.local` and set the value of the environment variable inside `.env.local` to your Userbase _App ID_ from [Step 1](#step-1:-create-a-userbase-account).

Your `.env.local` file will look like this:

```bash
 NEXT_PUBLIC_USERBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

  environment variable to the app during development.

You are now able to run and develop your Next.js + Userbase app locally with the following command:

<Snippet dark text="yarn dev" />

## Step 4: Deploying to Production

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
